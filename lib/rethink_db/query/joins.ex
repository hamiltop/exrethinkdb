  Returns an inner join of two sequences. The returned sequence represents an
  intersection of the left-hand sequence and the right-hand sequence: each row of
  the left-hand sequence will be compared with each row of the right-hand
  sequence to find all pairs of rows which satisfy the predicate. Each matched
  pair of rows of both sequences are combined into a result row. In most cases,
  you will want to follow the join with `zip` to combine the left and right results.

  Note that `inner_join` is slower and much less efficient than using `eqJoin` or
  `flat_map` with `get_all`. You should avoid using `inner_join` in commands when
  possible.

  Returns a left outer join of two sequences. The returned sequence represents

  Join tables using a field on the left-hand sequence matching primary keys or
  secondary indexes on the right-hand table. `eq_join` is more efficient than other
  ReQL join types, and operates much faster. Documents in the result set consist
  of pairs of left-hand and right-hand documents, matched when the field on the
  left-hand side exists and is non-null and an entry with that field’s value
  exists in the specified index on the right-hand side.

  The result set of `eq_join` is a stream or array of objects. Each object in the
  returned set will be an object of the form `{ left: <left-document>, right:
  <right-document> }`, where the values of left and right will be the joined
  documents. Use the zip command to merge the left and right fields together.
